/*
 * Adding vendors JS library.
 * Example: // @requires filename.js
 *
 * Alternative way to add vendors scripts is to use 'wp_enqueue_script()' function in functions.php of your active theme.
 * All scripts in folder src/js will be included in vendors.js excepting file custom.js.
 * Both js-files as custom.js and vendors.js are included in functions.php by wp_enqueue_script() function.
